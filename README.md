[*SparkFun 9 Degrees of Freedom - Sensor Stick (SEN-10724)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10724)


The SparkFun 9DOF Sensor Stick is a very small sensor board with 9 degrees of freedom. 
It includes the ADXL345 accelerometer, the HMC5883L magnetometer, and the ITG-3200 MEMS gyro. 
The ‘stick’ has a simple I2C interface and a mounting hole for attaching it to your project.
 Also, the board is a mere 0.036" thick (0.093" overall), allowing it to be easily mounted in just about any application.
